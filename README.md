##The repository for recipies

This repository will contain recipies that I have tried out and happy with.

Everyone is welcomed to contribute, change a proportion or ingredient or steps/temperature etc., just submit a pull request and it will be pulled as soon as I try it out and am happy with it as well.

A few rules though:
1. Metric system only measurements (no cups, ounces or Fahrenheit, sorry Americans), tablespoon and teaspoon excepted.
2. Be clear in giving instructions, no vagueness, ie. chop up the carrots (how exactly? Julienne, cube?).
3. Ingredients before quantity. Ingredients before instructions.

Any recipies that I cannot try out (because it uses some very special equipment or other reasons) will not be included because I can't vouch for its quality. Feel free to fork though.
